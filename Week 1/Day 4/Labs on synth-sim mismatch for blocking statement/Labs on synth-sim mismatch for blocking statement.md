## üìñ Section 1.1: The Blocking Statement Caveat

### 1.1.1 Introduction
- Common issue in digital design: **synthesis-simulation mismatch**.  
- Mismatch occurs when RTL sim ‚â† Synthesis hardware behaviour.  
- **Cause**: Using blocking statements (`=`) incorrectly inside `always` blocks.  
- **Objective**: Show how blocking assignments can mislead simulation.

### 1.1.2 Intended Logic Design
- **Target Boolean Expression**:  
  \[
  D = (A \; OR \; B) \; AND \; C
  \]
- Implementation:  
  - OR gate for `(A OR B)`  
  - Output fed into AND gate with `C`

### 1.1.3 Verilog Implementation and Flaw
always @(*) begin
d = x & c; // uses x before it is upda
ed x = a | b; // blocking statements executed in

- **Flaw**: Blocking (`=`) executes sequentially inside block.  
- At evaluation, `d` uses the **old value of x** from previous cycle.  
- **Effect**: Creates unintended memory (looks like a flop).

## üßÆ Section 1.2: Simulation vs Synthesis

### 1.2.1 RTL Simulation Behaviour
- **Observation**: Waveform shows incorrect sequential-like behaviour.  
- Example:  
  - When `A=0, B=0, C=1`, expected `(A|B)&C = 0`.  
  - RTL Simulation ‚Üí D = 1 (incorrect).  
- **Reason**: D was computed using old/stale `x`.  
- **Conclusion**: RTL sim looked as if `x` was a register ‚Üí an "imaginary flop".

### 1.2.2 Synthesis and Netlist Analysis
- **Synthesiser Result**:  
  - Pure combinational circuit.  
  - LHS of netlist: **1 OR gate + 1 AND gate**.  
  - ‚úÖ No register/latch inferred.  
- **Conclusion**: Synth tool correctly interprets intent as combinational.  

---

### 1.2.3 Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) Behaviour
- **GLS Waveform**: Matches intended combinational logic.  
- Example:  
  - If `A=0, B=0, C=1` ‚Üí D=0 (correct).  
  - Output reflects instantaneous inputs ‚Üí no storage element.  
- ‚úÖ Confirms mismatch cause is only in **RTL sim**.

## üìù Section 1.3: Conclusions and Best Practices

### 1.3.1 The Mismatch Explained
- **RTL Simulation**: Incorrect "sequential-like" behaviour.  
- **GLS / Hardware**: Correct combinational behaviour.  
- **Root Cause**: Misuse of blocking statements ‚Üí synthesis ignores sequencing, but simulator enforces it.  

---

### 1.3.2 Dangers and Industry Impact
- Can mislead designers into thinking a **flop exists** in RTL.  
- Synthesis removes it ‚Üí actual chip behaviour differs.  
- Late discovery ‚Üí "huge churn" in design cycles + costly rework.  

---

### 1.3.3 Recommendations
- **Golden Rule**:  
  > "You should be very, very careful with blocking statements."  
- **Avoid** `=` in most cases, especially in sequential/RTL modelling.  
- Prefer **non-blocking (`<=`)** for sequential logic.  
- Use blocking only for carefully checked combinational logic.  
- Sketch design behaviour on paper ‚Üí ensure clarity before coding.  

---

## ‚úÖ Final Takeaway
- Blocking assignments can **mislead simulation** while synthesis infers correct hardware.  
- Always verify with **GLS** to catch such mismatches.  
- Follow best practices: `always @(*)` + non-blocking for sequential logic.
