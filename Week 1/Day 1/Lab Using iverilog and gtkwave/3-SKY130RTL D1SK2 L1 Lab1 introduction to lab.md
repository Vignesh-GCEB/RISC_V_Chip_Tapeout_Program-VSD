## 2.0 Initial Directory and Tool Flow Setup
This section covers the initial steps to create a workspace and install the required tools.

### 2.1 Workspace Creation
- Create a main directory named **VLSI** to house all course-related files and tools.

### 2.2 VSD Flow Installation
- Inside the **VLSI** directory, the VSD flow should be installed.  
- Successful installation results in the creation of a new directory named **VSD flow**.  
- This directory will be populated with all the necessary cloned files for the tool flow.
