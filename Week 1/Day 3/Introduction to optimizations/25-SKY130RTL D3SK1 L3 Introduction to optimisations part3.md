# üöÄ Advanced Topics in Sequential Logic Optimisation

These notes cover **advanced optimisation techniques** in sequential logic synthesis.  
Unlike basic optimisation (e.g., Sequential Constant Propagation covered in labs), these concepts address **state machines, timing, and physical-aware optimisations** for high-performance hardware.

## üìñ 1.0 Overview of Advanced Techniques

- **State Optimisation**: Reducing or re-encoding states for efficient FSM design.  
- **Logic Cloning**: Addressing physical routing delays by duplicating logic.  
- **Retiming**: Repositioning logic across flip-flops to balance critical paths.

## üî¢ 2.0 State Optimisation

- **Definition**: Optimises the number and encoding of states in a finite state machine (FSM).  
- **Goal**: Reduce unused states and represent the FSM in the **most condensed, efficient form**.  
- **Benefit**: Smaller and faster state machines lead to **significant sequential optimisation**.

## üß¨ 3.0 Cloning of Logic

### 3.1 Definition and Purpose
- **Cloning of Logic**: A physical-aware synthesis technique.  
- **Goal**: Mitigate **large routing delays** by duplicating sequential elements.  

### 3.2 Problem Scenario: Large Routing Delays
- Flop A drives Flop B and Flop C.  
- Placement issue: A, B, C are at distant locations on the chip (e.g., corners).  
- Result: Long routes ‚Üí large routing delays ‚Üí **timing violations**.  

### 3.3 The Cloning Solution
- **Key Prerequisite**: Positive slack available at Flop A.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Duplicate Flop A into two copies.  
  - Place one close to Flop B, and the other close to Flop C.  
- **Outcome**:  
  - Shorter routes from duplicated flops to B and C.  
  - Original slack at A absorbs extra delay due to duplication.  
  - Design **meets timing closure** effectively.

## ‚è±Ô∏è 4.0 Retiming

### 4.1 Definition and Purpose
- Retiming is a sequential optimisation method that:  
  - **Moves logic across flip-flops**.  
  - Balances timing in different pipeline stages.  
  - Increases the **maximum clock frequency (performance)**.  
- Relies on redistributing **useful slack** from fast paths into slow (critical) paths.  

### 4.2 Illustrative Example

- **Initial Circuit State**:  
  - Stage 1 delay = **5 ns**  
  - Stage 2 delay = **2 ns**  
  - Clock period = 5 ns (limited by Stage 1)  
  - Operating frequency = **200 MHz**  
  - Stage 2 slack = 3 ns (5 - 2)  

- **Apply Retiming**:  
  - Move ~1 ns logic from Stage 1 ‚Üí Stage 2.  

- **New Circuit State**:  
  - Stage 1 delay = 4 ns  
  - Stage 2 delay = 3 ns  
  - Max delay = 4 ns  
  - New frequency = **250 MHz**  

### 4.3 Summary of Benefit
- Retiming improves system performance by **redistributing delays**.  
- Frees unused slack in faster paths to improve bottlenecks.  
- Boost example: **200 MHz ‚Üí 250 MHz**.  
- A powerful optimisation for **pipelined designs**.
