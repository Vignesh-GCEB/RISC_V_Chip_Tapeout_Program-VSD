# üìò Understanding Combinational Circuits and Flip-Flops

This document explains the **problems with combinational circuits** due to propagation delays and glitches, and how **flip-flops** provide a reliable solution to stabilize signals in digital design.

## ‚ö° Chapter 1: The Problem with Combinational Circuits

### 1.1 Combinational Logic and Propagation Delay
- **Definition**:  
  A **combinational circuit** produces outputs purely based on present inputs.  
  Example: An AND gate.  
- **Propagation Delay**:  
  - Outputs do not update instantly after input changes.  
  - Each gate/path has its own delay.  
  - Example:  
    - AND gate ‚Üí 2 ns delay  
    - OR gate ‚Üí 1 ns delay

### 1.2 The Phenomenon of Glitches
- **Definition**:  
  A **glitch** is a temporary, unwanted transition in output before it stabilises.  
- **Cause**: Different propagation delays on signal paths.  
- **Example Boolean Expression**:  
Y = (A AND B) OR C

- **Scenario**:  
- Initial: A=0, B=0, C=1 ‚Üí Y = 1  
- Inputs transition: A=1, B=1, C=0  
- Expected final: Y = 1  
- **Glitch Formation**:  
1. C drops first; OR gate updates after 1 ns ‚Üí Y becomes 0.  
2. AND gate (A & B) updates after 2 ns ‚Üí output goes high.  
3. OR gate responds after another 1 ns ‚Üí Y returns to 1.  
- Output transitions: **1 ‚Üí 0 ‚Üí 1** (glitch).

### 1.3 Cascading Glitches
- When many combinational blocks are chained, glitches propagate forward.  
- More stages = more instability.  
- In continuous cascades, outputs may **never settle**, remaining in flux ‚Üí highly undesirable in digital systems.

## üïí Chapter 2: The Solution ‚Äì Flip-Flops (Flops)

### 2.1 Introducing the Flip-Flop
- **Purpose**: Prevent continuous glitch propagation in combinational logic.  
- **Definition**:  
A **flip-flop** (e.g., D Flip-Flop) is a **storage element** that holds and releases values under controlled timing.  

---

### 2.2 How Flops Prevent Glitches
- **Strategic Placement**:  
Place flops between combinational logic blocks.  
- **Clocking Principle**:  
- Flop‚Äôs output (`Q`) only updates at the active clock edge.  
- Even if input (`D`) glitches ‚Üí output remains stable until clock edge arrives.  
- **Shielding Effect**:  
- `Q` is **isolated** from direct changes on `D` when no clock edge occurs.  
- **Creating Stability**:  
- Stable `Q` input for the next combinational stage.  
- Ensures each stage settles correctly without continuous glitching.

### 2.3 The Need for Flop Initialisation
- **Initial State Requirement**:  
Flops must have a defined value at power-on.  
- **Without Initialisation**:  
- Outputs are ‚Äúgarbage/unknown‚Äù.  
- Propagates instability into the circuit.  
- **Control Pins**:  
Flops integrate **reset** or **set** inputs for initialisation.  
- **Types of Initialisation**:  
| Type        | Behaviour |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Asynchronous** | Reset/set occurs immediately, independent of clock |
| **Synchronous**  | Reset/set occurs only on clock edge |

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways
- Combinational circuits face **propagation delay ‚Üí glitches**.  
- Glitches worsen in cascaded designs.  
- **Flip-flops** solve this by:  
- Syncing outputs to the **clock edge**  
- Preventing glitch propagation  
- Ensuring circuit stability with reset/set initialisation.  
- The combination of **combinational logic + flip-flops** forms the backbone of reliable synchronous digital design.
